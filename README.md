# ImageRecognition-Alert
A python script using python_imagesearch to recognise given image in region and plays alert

Gui made with tkinter, original purpose is to monitor a region on screen and sound an alert when given image is found within the region.
I use it when playing EVE Online to alert me when a "neutral" or "red" player enters local area.
